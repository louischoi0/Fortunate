---

Randomness is a big part of games or even real life. we buy lottery and enter a draw to win.  However for applicants there is no way to verify faireness in foker game or raffles or rpg games. and process is not transparent to user. And there has been many attempts to manipulate system (like tazza in korean word). So fortunate solve this problems as to provide random state api which is verifiable.
